    <h1>My Journey</h1>
    <p>Life to me is like an endless tunnel that one needs to explore.Like a tunnel it has hidden holes surpirising things and hideous things.It could be quite lonely and fun to explore. Its silence is intimidating and scary and at the same time quite serene. Listening to all those sounds makes you shudder or feel the adventure begins! Well that's my life just like a tunnel.At a young age my imagination took the better part of me. I stayed in a fairy tale kind of world that seemed fun and peaceful to be part of. I would have conversations with my 'band' friends,travel the world in my own private jet,sip on milkshakes beside my pool,play with my dogs Chimo and Nanook,give Tedtalks to young ladies and gents starting their carees in tech,go hiking with Lily,Deira,Tim and Zonk,Swim with Petra and Josh,Coffee with Rick,Partying with Julie,Diane,Marc,Nick,Benie and at the end of the day retire to bed in my indie bedroom with nice music from U2 and Girl in Red.</p>
    <h2>Real life</h2>
   <p> Well real life is real life. You get to interact with as many people as you want. You have to survive to eat.To have my dogs,house,cars and party you actually need money. You need to interact to have friends. You don't just wake up and have people ringing your door bell and being like :"Hey! I am your friend let's go out! Nah ! You have to also work for one of those door bell ringers.Well that's life cope,behave,have fun and don't be depressed!</p>
   <h3>Little,Small and Big</h3>
   <p>According to humans dreams are big,dreams are small. Little brains have small dreams and big brains have big dreams that's just how it goes.I disagree with all ! Everyone has big dreams. Little dreams are big dreams. You want to go to London they say you're dream is small,but I say that's a big dream chase it! Doesn't matter what they say.Little is big and big is big or small too. When you thinkk about it I might be correct.</p>
   <h4>Just be</h4>
   <p>Well I do not give advice but I just want to let you know. Be you and do not change your dreams,hopes and visions because said that's too small. Do it! Go to London if you want. Stay in your head if you want. Do you !</p>
